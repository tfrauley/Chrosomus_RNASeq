# Chrosomus Dace RNASeq Project

## Description
This repository contains all original coding files for the Chrosomus Differential Gene Expression Project, conducted at the University of Guelph during the 2022-2023 academic year. Majority of computing was done on a UNIX system, through a remote connection to the Digital Research Alliance of Canadas High Throughtput Computing Cluster, Cedar. DESeq2 analysis and Data visualizations were preformed using RStudio.

## Overview
Step 1: Align Reads to genome using STAR Aligner <br>
Step 2: Count reads using HtSeq <br>
Step 3: Analyze diffrential expression with DESeq2 <br>
